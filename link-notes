## LINKS

>The  <a> element uses the href attribute to indicate the page you are linking to.  
If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is     
best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.  
You can create links to open email programs with an email address in the "to" field.   
You can use the  id attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked too.

## LAYOUT

>Many web pages use multiple columns in their design. This is achieved by using a <div> element to represent each column.   
The following three CSS properties are used to position the columns next to each other:   
width This sets the width of the columns.  
float This positions the columns next to each other.  
margin This creates a gap between the columns.  
A two-column layout like the one shown on this page would need two <div> elements, one for the main content  
of the page and one for the sidebar. 
Inside each of the <div> elements there can be headings
